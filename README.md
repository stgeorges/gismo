# Gismo
Gismo is a free and open source Grasshopper plugin for GIS environmental analysis.



# Description:
Gismo enables automatic generation of urban environment and terrain geometry based on location's latitude-longitude coordinates and radius. This includes connection with openstreetmap website and generation of buildings, trees, roads, rivers and other map elements. 3d building elements can also be used as a context for further analysis types: isovist (visibility), solar radiation, thermal/wind comfort, cfd analysis...
